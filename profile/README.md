# nightshade network
*we make software, sometimes*

nightshade network is a long-term software project by [astelle nightshade](https://github.com/ry00001) and friends.  
it is a collection of private-use services for stelle and her friends. don't expect much of public use to come from here.

if you're interested, [contact me](mailto:admin@nightshade.network). i would love to talk infra.

nightshade network is built on [hetzner](https://hetzner.com), [tailscale](https://tailscale.com), and [nixos](https://nixos.org).  
(i do not receive payment for these services, in fact, i pay *them*. they're just good.)
